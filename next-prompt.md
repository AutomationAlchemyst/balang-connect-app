# User Profile Dashboard

A premium user dashboard where customers can track their active Infaq contributions, view past event bookings, and manage their preferences. 

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
The "Breezy Balang Welcome" design system embodies a **Premium Coastal Immersive** aesthetic, described as "Coastal Glassmorphism." The vibe is airy, refreshing, and high-end, utilizing deep oceanic contrasts against bright, sun-bleached surfaces. It prioritizes depth through layering and transparency, evoking the clarity of coastal waters and the softness of beach-front luxury.

- **Midnight Sea (#041F1C):** Primary Typography.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use `backdrop-blur-2xl` and `white/40` backgrounds for all card containers.
- **Typography:** `Plus Jakarta Sans`, Black weights for headers.

**Page Structure:**
1. Header with navigation
2. Welcome section with user stats (Total Infaq, Events Booked)
3. Active Orders / Tracking grid
4. Account Settings glass panel
